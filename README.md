<a name="en"><h3>About this project</h3></a>

**Fruiteria Emilio** was my last Java project when I was coursing first year of Web Applications Development vocational course.

We were demanded to make a Java application for **Emilio**, a local fruitshop owner who needs an app to manage the products he sells.

The app must be able to:

- Add new products

- Edit products

- Delete products

- Add new categories

- Modify categories

- Delete categories (only if there are no products associated with that category, the app will notify to the user if there are associated products and must not allow to delete that category).

- Filter by category and stock lower than a number given by the user.

- Sort by all table fields.

- Show stock's total price.

- Clean up the filters.
